**Overall:**
Great work on this assignment!

**Some notes**  
* When we refer to an _outcome_, we can often be referring to results (as in, we may find that having a high GRE makes you much more likely to be admitted to grad school), but we also refer to _outcome variables_ or _dependent variables_. In this case, our outcome would be _admitted_ or _not admitted_.
* Another goal of exploratory analysis is to find out if there is anything we have to _do_ to the data. You may have heard that most data scientists spend lots of time working with _data cleaning_, well this is what we mean! Ask yourself questions like: are there outliers in this dataset? Is there any data missing? Are there any errors in the data? Are there any manipulations we have to do?
* Regarding your point on non-linearity: yes this is true! It is also true that you would not want to encode ordinality to your categorical variables, so we take advantage of a technique known as [One Hot Encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f).
