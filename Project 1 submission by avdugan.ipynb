    "The assumption is that a higher prestige value may place more weight on the GPA score of a applicant because a high GPA at a more prestigious school carries more weight than a high GPA at a less prestigious school.   By looking at GPA and prestige together, this may be a better predictor of admission because it may suggest how much weight the admission decision puts on GRE vs GPA scores. \n",
